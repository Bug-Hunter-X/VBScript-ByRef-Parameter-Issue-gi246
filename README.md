This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to the use of ByRef parameters in VBScript functions. The example shows a function that attempts to modify a variable passed by reference; however, the modification does not persist outside the function. This often leads to unexpected behavior and debugging challenges. The solution provides a corrected approach to achieve the desired variable modification.
